> Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

#### **Variant #1** Add `key={num}` the best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:
```javascript
<ul>
    {numbers.map((num) => (
        <li key={num}>{num}</li>    
    ))}
</ul>
```
#### **Variant #2** Add `index` when you donâ€™t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:
```javascript
<ul>
    {numbers.map((num, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{num}</li>    
    ))}
</ul>
```
